sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
Bubble sort's best case (sorted array) is Ω(n)
worse case is O(n2)

sorted time is less than random,reversed a lot

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
Merge sort's best case (sorted array) is Ω(nlogn)
worse case is O(nlogn)

1. random,sorted,reversed all spent the same time
2. random,sorted,reversed time are average less than others

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
Selection sort's best case (sorted array) is Ω(n2)
worse case is O(n2)

1. random,sorted,reversed all spent the same time
2. all spent time are more than others's sorted
